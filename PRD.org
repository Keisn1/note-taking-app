* PRD note taking app
** Introduction:
The Note-Taking App aims to provide users with a simple yet powerful tool to organize, store, and retrieve their notes seamlessly, enhancing productivity and streamlining the note-taking process.
** Problem Statement:
Existing note-taking apps lack key features, leading users to juggle multiple applications or resort to outdated methods, resulting in inefficiencies and disorganization. There is a clear need for a comprehensive solution that addresses these pain points effectively.

** Goals and Objectives for MVP (Backend):
1. Develop a scalable backend infrastructure for basic note storage and retrieval.
2. Implement user authentication and access control.
3. Utilize GORM with PostgreSQL and MongoDB for two different versions of the MVP.
4. Optimize backend performance for single-device access and user interaction.
5. Focus on reliability, security, and documentation to ensure successful backend implementation.

** User Stories for MVP:
1. As a user, I want to be able to sign up for an account and log in securely to access my notes.
2. As a user, I want to create new notes and save them to my account.
3. As a user, I want to view and edit existing notes stored in my account.
4. As a user, I want a simple and intuitive interface to easily navigate and manage my notes.
5. As a user, I want my notes to be saved and accessible only on the device I am currently using.
6. As a user, I want the option to delete notes that I no longer need.
7. User can sign up, log in securely, create, view, and edit notes.
8. Notes are accessible only on the device in use.
9. Users can delete unnecessary notes.

** Technical Requirements for MVP (Backend):
1. Server-Side Framework:
   - Implement the backend logic using Go programming language, leveraging the efficiency and scalability it offers for web application development.
2. Database Management with GORM:
   - Utilize GORM, a popular ORM library for Go, to interact with a PostgreSQL database for one version of the MVP.
3. Database Management with MongoDB:
   - Utilize MongoDB, a NoSQL database, for the other version of the MVP, interacting with it using the mgo or official MongoDB driver for Go.
4. Authentication:
   - Integrate JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication for secure user login and access control within the Go codebase for both database versions.
5. RESTful APIs:
   - Design and implement RESTful API endpoints in Go using frameworks like Chi or Gin for CRUD operations on user notes for both versions.
6. Performance Optimization:
   - Optimize the Go codebase for improved performance, including efficient data retrieval and processing for both GORM and MongoDB versions.
7. Testing Environment:
   - Establish a testing environment for the Go backend and implement unit testing using testing libraries for both database versions.
8. Documentation:
   - Provide comprehensive documentation detailing the backend APIs, data structures, and technical implementation specifics for both GORM and MongoDB versions for future reference and maintenance.
9. Containerization:
   - Implement Docker containers for packaging the backend application and its dependencies, facilitating consistent deployment across different environments.

** KPIs for the MVP:
- User engagement, performance, adoption, scalability, and security metrics.
- Backend-specific indicators, including efficient data handling, reliable authentication, scalability testing, consistent testing results, secure data management, and documentation integrity.

** Conclusion:
The MVP of the Note-Taking App will focus on delivering a scalable, secure, and efficient backend solution that prioritizes single-device access and user interaction. By aligning with the outlined goals, objectives, user stories, technical requirements, KPIs, and success indicators, the backend implementation is set to drive the success and usability of the Note-Taking App, laying a solid foundation for future iterations and enhancements based on user feedback and validation.
